# Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware ML for Astrophysical Time-Series Inference

## Overview
This repository implements a **machine learning pipeline** for inferring astrophysical parameters from real observational time-series (light curves / RV signals) with explicit emphasis on **interpretability, uncertainty calibration, robustness, and physical consistency**.

## Scientific Objective
To perform **interpretable, calibrated, and robust inference** of astrophysical parameters from observational data under:
- Instrumental noise
- Irregular sampling
- Missing observations
- Domain shift across surveys

## Key Contributions
- Strong classical ML baselines with calibration
- Deep learning models for temporal inference
- Explainable AI mapped to physical quantities
- Robustness and domain generalization analysis


## Data
Data is obtained from TESS

Data handling includes:
- Quality flag filtering
- Gap handling and cadence normalization
- Dataset documentation via data cards
